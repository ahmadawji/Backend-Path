# Personal Budget API

Welcome to the Personal Budget API! This project allows clients to create and manage a personal budget using Envelope Budgeting principles. Users can manage budget envelopes and track the balance of each envelope. The API follows best practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, proper response codes, etc.
